# heatup

A chartbeat live readership widget.

Starts a fetch against chartbeat API

If current page is in toppages, it starts a more frequent polling for updates to the data.

Uses odometer.js to animate the numbers.

Currently implemented as proof of concept using chrome extension.

Should rely on an external server to handle caching of chartbeat data.
